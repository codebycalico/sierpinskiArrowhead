# sierpinskiArrowhead
 Sierpinski arrowhead fractal visual created with the mathematics from the Lindenmayer system.
To run and use the program, just compile with:
cc sierpinskiArrowhead.c -lm -lX11
Run the program and then hit any key to begin the loop. Again, pressing ‘c’ will iterate through the depths while clearing the screen in between so the user can see each depth clearly and individually. Pressing ‘q’ will exit the program. Pressing any other key will draw the curves at the various depths on top of each other without clearing the screen in between.
